    <h1>Accessible Blockly Music Game: Help</h1>

    <p>
      Blockly is a way of programming that works by linking blocks of code
      together.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two sections: a toolbox and a workspace. The toolbox is where
      all the blocks are kept. Each block has different options for what you can
      do with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The workspace is where you put the blocks you want to use. Once you put a
      block there, that block will have more options, like choosing a value,
      copying the block, or marking a spot where you will add another block.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you're ready to try out your code, choose the button "Run Code",
      which is at the top of the Workspace.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this Blockly game, you'll be writing code that makes music.
